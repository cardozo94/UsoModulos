# UsoModulos

This is a test project to get involve with new feature of Java called modules. I use Java 11.0.15 to it. But it should work since Java 9. It is related with [PruebasModulos][link_PruebasModulos] Project to see the full behaviour. I define as dependecy package *co.camcar.producto* with the reserved word __requires__ on *module-info.java*  otherwise I couldn't use classes from *co.camcar.producto* package.
